"805","After Essebsi became president, the vigor he'd plowed into pre-2015 politicking appeared rarely (eg: his years-long pursuit of 2017's Reconciliation Law). Meanwhile, on truly crucial matters (forming Constitutional Court, Nidaa collapse etc) he often seemed absent from the helm.","0"
"805","In Aug '13 the opposing camps leaders, Essebsi and Ghannouchi, met secretly in Paris. Their tense, mutually suspicious discussion breached the impasse and led to further talks, paving the way for Tunisia's Nobel Prize-winning National Dialogue to help resolve the impasse.","0"
"805","Tunisia's president, Essebsi, has died. He leaves a profoundly mixed legacy, having done much to both shepherd and sabotage Tunisia's transition. As president, he pursued soft resoration weakly, generally favouring impunity over democratic reform while his party, Nidaa, crumbled.","0"
"805","As president, Essebsi proved to be far less effective than his supporters had hoped and far less authoritarian than his critics had often feared. Tunisia's transition neither sank nor swam under his tenure, but chronically choked and sputtered- rudderless, wounded, yet still afloat.","0"
"805","In run-up to Tunisia's 2013 Bardo Crisis, Essebsi instigated dangerous calls to dissolve the country's Constituent Assembly w/o plans for a representative gov to replace it. Bardo swelled into a terrible impasse, nearly toppling transition. But in Aug '13 a breakthrough emerged","0"
"805","During 2013's Bardo Crisis, Essebsi acted as both a saboteur and saviour of Tunisian democracy. Though his demands endangered the transition, he later engaged in constructive dialogue w Ghannouchi, helping to claw Tunisia back from the brink of disaster.","0"
"805","To me, Essebsi's almost Shakespearean incapacity to prevent his son from domineering and arguably destroying Nidaa (which still exists but is riven into pieces and polling vv low) represents the greatest mystery of his tenure. Did Essebsi not see Nidaa through the lens of his legacy?","0"

"413","Here’s the video from last week where I lay it all out. 

IND seems like the most obvious trade partner. Frank Reich is there and they have 46M of QB contracts coming off the books this Summer.
