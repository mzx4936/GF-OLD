    abstract = {Abusive messages (flames) can be both a source of frustration and a waste of time for Internet users. This paper . describes some approaches to flame recognition, mcluding a prototype system, Smokey. Smokey builds a 47-element feature vector based on the syntax and semantics of each sentence, combining the vectors for the sentences within each message. A training set of 720 messages was used by Quinlan's C4.5 decision-tree generator to determine feature-based rules that were able to correctly categorize 64% of the flames and 98% of the nonflames in a separate test set of 460 messages. Additional techniques for greater accuracy and user customization are also discussed.},

    abstract = "Transfer learning and domain adaptive learning have been applied to various fields including computer vision (e.g., image recognition) and natural language processing (e.g., text classification). One of the benefits of transfer learning is to learn effectively and efficiently from limited labeled data with a pre-trained model. In the shared task of identifying and categorizing offensive language in social media, we preprocess the dataset according to the language behaviors on social media, and then adapt and fine-tune the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT) pre-trained by Google AI Language team. Our team NULI wins the first place (1st) in Sub-task A - Offensive Language Identification and is ranked 4th and 18th in Sub-task B - Automatic Categorization of Offense Types and Sub-task C - Offense Target Identification respectively.",
